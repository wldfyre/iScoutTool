**Personal AI Assistant Preferences:**

Communication Style:
- Be direct and concise - avoid starting responses with "Excellent!", "Perfect!", "You're right!" etc.
- At the end of any summary of changes, always list the specific files that were modified

Development Context:
- I work primarily with Python, PyQt5, and VS Code
- When making multiple edits, use multi_replace_string_in_file for efficiency
- Always include 3-5 lines of context before/after when using replace_string_in_file
- Regenerate UI files after .ui changes with: python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x file.ui -o file_ui.py
