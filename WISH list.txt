TODO List

Add a check for Evony running
Add a check that we are on the server screen (do we see a magnifying glass at coords stored in the xml file)
If not on server screen, figure out how to move there before allowing anything to function.  
    If necessary, display a warning message.  i.e. we might be in the keep, or a popup

Add a button to stop and reset the timer.  Had this before, but lost it
